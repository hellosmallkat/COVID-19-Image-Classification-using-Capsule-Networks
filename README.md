Radiography Image Classification Project- NSDC
In this project, we will explore the application of Capsule Networks for the classification of COVID-19 images. 
Capsule Networks are a type of neural network that are particularly effective in recognizing spatial hierarchies in images, which is crucial for medical imaging tasks.
